LLM Prompts for Procedure and Medical Device extraction.
"""

PROCEDURES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert clinical protocol analyst specializing in extracting 
procedure and medical device information from clinical trial protocols.

Your task is to identify:
1. Clinical procedures performed during the study
2. Medical devices used (drug delivery, diagnostic, monitoring devices)
3. Drug ingredients and their strengths

Return valid JSON only."""

PROCEDURES_USER_PROMPT = """Extract all Procedures, Medical Devices, and Drug Ingredients from the following protocol text.

**Procedures to extract:**
- Sampling procedures (blood draws, biopsies, urine collection)
- Diagnostic procedures (imaging, ECG, endoscopy)
- Therapeutic procedures (infusions, injections)
- Monitoring procedures (vital signs, telemetry)
- Assessment procedures (physical exams, neurological assessments)

**Medical Devices to extract:**
- Drug delivery devices (infusion pumps, autoinjectors, inhalers, syringes)
- Monitoring devices (glucose monitors, ECG devices, wearables)
- Diagnostic devices (spirometers, imaging equipment)
- Venous access devices (cannulas, catheters, IV lines)
- Any specific device mentioned by name or model

**DO NOT classify as medical devices:**
- Drug formulations (tablets, capsules, pills, solutions, suspensions)
- The study drug itself (this is an intervention, not a device)
- Chemical compounds or active ingredients

**Ingredients/Strengths to extract:**
- Active pharmaceutical ingredients
- Excipients if mentioned
- Drug strengths and concentrations
