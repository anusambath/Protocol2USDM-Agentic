LLM Prompts for Objectives & Endpoints Extraction.

Split into two focused phases for improved reliability:
1. OBJECTIVES_ENDPOINTS_PROMPT - Extract objectives and endpoints (core, always succeeds)
2. ESTIMANDS_PROMPT - Extract estimands with endpoint context (enhancement phase)

This separation improves reliability by:
- Reducing prompt complexity and output size
- Ensuring core objectives/endpoints always extract successfully
- Allowing estimands to reference already-extracted endpoint IDs
- Making each prompt easier to tune independently

Output format follows USDM v4.0 OpenAPI schema requirements.

# =============================================================================
# PHASE 1: Objectives & Endpoints (Core extraction - always runs)
# =============================================================================

OBJECTIVES_ENDPOINTS_PROMPT = """You are an expert at extracting study objectives and endpoints from clinical trial protocols.
Extract ALL objectives and their associated endpoints. Output must conform to USDM v4.0 schema.

## Study Objectives (by level)
- **Primary**: Main purpose of the study
- **Secondary**: Additional goals (safety, tolerability, etc.)
- **Exploratory**: Hypothesis-generating objectives

## Endpoints (matched to objectives)
- **Primary**: Main outcome measures for primary objectives
- **Secondary**: Supporting outcome measures
- **Exploratory**: Additional exploratory measures

## USDM v4.0 Output Format

  "objectives": [
    {
      "id": "obj_1",
      "name": "Primary Efficacy Objective",
      "text": "To evaluate the efficacy of Drug X compared to placebo",

  ]
}

## Level Codes
- Primary, Secondary, Exploratory

## Purpose Values
- Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Biomarker, QualityOfLife

## Rules
1. Every entity MUST have `id` and `instanceType`
2. Use sequential IDs: obj_1, obj_2; ep_1, ep_2
3. Link objectives to endpoints via `endpointIds` array
4. Extract exact text verbatim from protocol
5. Classify correctly by level
6. Be complete - extract ALL objectives and endpoints
7. Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations

Now extract objectives and endpoints from the protocol:

# PHASE 2: Estimands (Enhancement - runs after objectives/endpoints)
# =============================================================================

ESTIMANDS_PROMPT = """You are an expert at extracting estimands from clinical trial protocols using the ICH E9(R1) framework.

## Previously Extracted Endpoints
{endpoints_context}

## ICH E9(R1) Estimand Framework

An estimand precisely describes the treatment effect. Extract ALL FIVE attributes:

1. **Treatment** - Intervention AND comparator with specific names
2. **Population** - Target patients AND analysis population (ITT, PP, mITT, etc.)
3. **Variable** - The endpoint being measured (MUST reference endpoint ID from above)
4. **Intercurrent Events** - Events affecting interpretation WITH handling strategy
5. **Summary Measure** - Statistical summary (difference in means, hazard ratio, odds ratio, etc.)

## Intercurrent Event Strategies (MUST specify one)
- **Treatment Policy** - Include all data regardless of event
- **Composite** - Event becomes part of outcome
- **Hypothetical** - Estimate as if event hadn't occurred
- **Principal Stratum** - Subset who wouldn't experience event
- **While on Treatment** - Only data while on treatment

  ]
}}
```

## CRITICAL Rules
1. **MUST link to endpoint IDs** from Phase 1 using endpointId field
2. **MUST include summaryMeasure** - the statistical method (e.g., "Difference in means", "Hazard ratio")
3. **MUST include at least one intercurrentEvent** with strategy
4. **MUST include analysisPopulation** - the population type (ITT, PP, Safety, etc.)
5. **MUST include interventionNames** - list of intervention names being compared
6. Extract at least one estimand for each primary endpoint
7. Include common intercurrent events (discontinuation, rescue medication) even if not explicit
8. Return ONLY valid JSON
