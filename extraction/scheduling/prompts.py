LLM Prompts for Scheduling Logic extraction.

SCHEDULING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert clinical protocol analyst specializing in study timing, 
visit windows, and protocol decision logic.

Your task is to extract:
1. Timing constraints (visit windows, intervals between visits)
2. Transition rules (criteria for moving between study phases)
3. Conditions for branching or adaptive designs
4. Early termination and discontinuation criteria

Return valid JSON only."""

SCHEDULING_USER_PROMPT = """Extract all Scheduling Logic from the following protocol text.

**Timing to extract:**
- Visit windows (e.g., "Day 1 ± 3 days")
- Intervals between visits (e.g., "4 weeks after previous visit")
- Time relative to events (e.g., "within 7 days of screening")

**Transition Rules to extract:**
- Criteria for epoch transitions (e.g., screening to treatment)
- Discontinuation criteria
- Rescue therapy rules
- Dose modification triggers

**Conditions to extract:**
- Eligibility conditions beyond inclusion/exclusion
- Response-based decisions
- Safety stopping rules
- Interim analysis conditions

**Schedule Exits to extract:**
- Early termination criteria
- Study completion criteria
- Protocol deviations leading to exit
