"""
Text Extractor - Text-based SoA data extraction.

This module extracts the DATA from protocol text:
- Activities (procedures, assessments) with full details
- ActivityTimepoints (the tick matrix)

It uses the HeaderStructure from vision analysis as an ANCHOR:
- Uses the EXACT IDs from header structure for timepoints/encounters
- Maps activities to the correct timepoints using those IDs
- Prevents ID mismatches between vision and text

This is the PRIMARY data source. Vision provides structure, text provides data.

Usage:
    from extraction.text_extractor import extract_soa_from_text
    from extraction.header_analyzer import load_header_structure
    
    header = load_header_structure("4_soa_header_structure.json")
    result = extract_soa_from_text(protocol_text, header, model_name="gemini-2.5-pro")

Your output must conform to USDM v4.0 schema specifications.

## HEADER STRUCTURE (from visual analysis)
The following structure has been extracted from the SoA table images. 
You MUST use these EXACT IDs when referencing timepoints and encounters.

```json
{header_json}
```

## ACTIVITY GROUPS (row section headers)
The following activity groups (section headers) were identified in the SoA table:
{group_list}

**IMPORTANT:** If activity names are shown after "→ activities:", these are the expected activities
under that group (detected visually). Use this as a HINT for assigning `activityGroupId`.

These are CATEGORY HEADERS that group related activities. They are typically:
- Bold or highlighted rows
- Spanning the full table width
- Have NO tick marks (they are headers, not activities)

## YOUR TASK
Extract the ACTIVITIES and TICK MATRIX from the protocol text.

For each activity row in the SoA table:
1. Extract the activity name and description  
2. Assign it to its parent group using `activityGroupId`
3. Identify which timepoints have a tick (X, ✓, or similar marker)
4. Create an ActivityTimepoint entry for EACH tick
5. **IMPORTANT**: If a tick has a superscript footnote reference (e.g., "X^a", "✓^m", "X^a,b"),
   capture the footnote letters in the `footnoteRefs` array (e.g., ["a"] or ["a", "b"])

## USDM v4.0 Output Format (MUST follow exactly)

Every entity MUST have `id` and `instanceType` fields.
Every activity MUST have `activityGroupId` linking it to its parent group.

```json
{{
  "activities": [
    {{
      "id": "act_1",
      "name": "Informed Consent",
      "description": "Obtain written informed consent from participant",
      "activityGroupId": "grp_1",
      "instanceType": "Activity"
    }},
    {{
      "id": "act_2",
      "name": "Physical Examination",
      "description": "Complete physical examination",
      "activityGroupId": "grp_2",
      "instanceType": "Activity"
    }},
    {{
      "id": "act_3",
      "name": "Blood Sampling for PK",
      "description": "PK blood samples",
      "activityGroupId": "grp_3",
      "instanceType": "Activity"
    }}
  ],
  "activityTimepoints": [
    {{
      "id": "at_1",
      "activityId": "act_1",
      "encounterId": "enc_1",
      "instanceType": "ActivityTimepoint"
    }},
    {{
      "id": "at_2",
      "activityId": "act_2",
      "encounterId": "enc_1",
      "footnoteRefs": ["a"],
      "instanceType": "ActivityTimepoint"
    }},
    {{
      "id": "at_3",
      "activityId": "act_3",
      "encounterId": "enc_2",
      "footnoteRefs": ["m", "n"],
      "instanceType": "ActivityTimepoint"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Every entity MUST have `id` and `instanceType`** - mandatory for USDM compliance
2. **Use sequential IDs** - act_1, act_2 for activities; at_1, at_2 for timepoints
3. **Use EXACT encounter IDs from header structure** for encounterId (enc_1, enc_2, etc.) - do not create new ones
4. **ONLY create ActivityTimepoints where you see explicit tick marks** (X, ✓, •)
5. **Do NOT infer ticks** from clinical logic or "at every visit" text
6. **If unsure about a tick, OMIT it** - false negatives are better than false positives
7. **DO NOT include group headers as activities** - only extract the individual activities UNDER each group
8. **Include ALL activities** from the SoA table with their descriptions
9. **Every activity MUST have `activityGroupId`** - MANDATORY, see rules below

## HOW TO ASSIGN activityGroupId (MANDATORY)

Look at the header structure's rowGroups. Each activity belongs to the group whose header row appears ABOVE it in the table.

Example: If the header structure has:
- grp_1: "Eligibility" 
- grp_2: "Safety Assessments"
- grp_3: "PK/PD Analyses"

And the table shows:
```
Eligibility              <- group header (grp_1)
  Informed Consent       <- activityGroupId: "grp_1"
  Demographics           <- activityGroupId: "grp_1"
Safety Assessments       <- group header (grp_2)
  Vital Signs            <- activityGroupId: "grp_2"
  Physical Exam          <- activityGroupId: "grp_2"
PK/PD Analyses           <- group header (grp_3)
  Blood Sampling for PK  <- activityGroupId: "grp_3"
```

**If no groups exist, use "grp_default" for all activities.**

## Activity Fields
- `id`: Unique identifier (act_1, act_2, etc.)
- `name`: Activity name exactly as shown in SoA
- `description`: Expanded description if available (can be same as name)
- `activityGroupId`: The ID of the parent group (grp_1, grp_2, etc.) - REQUIRED
- `instanceType`: Must be "Activity"

## ActivityTimepoint Fields  
- `id`: Unique identifier (at_1, at_2, etc.)
- `activityId`: Reference to the activity (must match an activity's id)
- `encounterId`: Reference to encounter from header (enc_1, enc_2, etc.) - must match exactly
- `footnoteRefs`: (OPTIONAL) Array of footnote letters if the tick has superscript references
  - Example: "X^a" → `["a"]`, "✓^m,n" → `["m", "n"]`
  - Only include if superscript is present on the tick mark
- `instanceType`: Must be "ActivityTimepoint"

Output ONLY the JSON object, no explanations or markdown fences.

## STRICT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

**YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE EXACTLY THIS STRUCTURE:**
```
{{
  "activities": [...],
  "activityTimepoints": [...]
}}
```

**DO NOT:**
- Wrap in "study", "studyDesigns", or any USDM container
- Use "activityGroups" with "activityNames" arrays
- Add any other top-level keys
- Return nested structures

**DO:**
- Return FLAT JSON with only "activities" and "activityTimepoints" at root
- Each activity must have: id, name, activityGroupId, instanceType
- Each timepoint must have: id, activityId, encounterId, instanceType"""
